### About
Set in a post-apocalyptic future where the publics rampant demand for more extreme forms of entertainment is at an all-time high and
where all other sports are deemed too safe for work. 2 Players battle it out in the ultimate sport, football with cars!

Race for the ball, tactically utilize the boost system to outrun your opponent, shoot or save game changing goals.
Slothit League is high octane, adrenaline packed and out now!

### Slothit League includes;
- Exhilarating 1980's gameplay
- Graphics and audio compliant with Atari 2600 standards
- A fully featured game manual with meta achievements
And much more!

This project was coded in C# by a team of 4 students, including myself, over the course of one weekend for our universities retro game jam.

The original unity project can be viewed and downloaded from our github repository [here](https://github.com/JohnnersUK/SlothitLeague)

_This game has no affiliation with the creators Rocket League, it's just a silly uni project_
