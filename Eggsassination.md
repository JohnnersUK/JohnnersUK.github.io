### Eggsassination features:
- Solo and 4 player party modes
- A fully featured stealth system
- A plethora of traps to get lost in
- over 50 achievements to unlock!
- Rare hats and customization items
And much more!

This project was coded in C# by a team of 4 students, including myself, over the course of one weekend for our universities party game jam.

The original unity project, including a standalone build of the game, can be viewed and downloaded from our github repository [here](https://github.com/brynfduwe/Eggsassination). 

_This game has no affiliation with the creators Rocket League, it's just a silly uni project_
