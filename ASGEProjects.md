### About
ASGE is a bare bones game engine made by one of my university lecturers, in c++ using openGL.
Throughout my second year of university we used this engine extensively to rapidly develop and test game mechanics in c++
at a low level so that we could get a deeper understanding of the internals of game engines. Here are some of the projects I made in ASGE

### Duck duck evolution

Snake but with ducks!

In this new take of an old classic, players must rescuing eggs that have fallen from their nest into the pond, with each egg they rescue the faster they get. Players may chose to tap out at any time by delivering the eggs back to the nest, the more eggs a player delivers the more they'll slow down and the greater the score they will gain.

This project was coded in c++. The source code for this project can be found [Here (github)](https://github.com/JohnnersUK/Duck-duck-evolution) and can be compiled in visual studio 2017 with the Windows SDK 10.0.16299.0.

### Dinky little dino

Dinky little dino is a simplistic infinite runner currently under development by Oscar Johnson (Me). You play as a blood fuelled dinosaur who must scale the mountainous terrain of the far east, smashing anything that gets in your way.

As of alpha build 0.1 the game has semi-feature terrain generation with a controllable character, along with a simple scoring system. The future road map would look as follows;

- Complete the terrain generation system
- Implement obstacles such as spikes, ballistic missiles and Mothra
- Finish the character controller, adding kick and fireball attacks with animations
- Add civilians, buildings and other score increasing pickups

### Birdmans Break-in

Based off of the academy award winning film Birdman. Comes a game 3 students made in 4 weeks.

Play as birdman, a down on his luck actor looking for his next break of fame. Use your wit and problem-solving skills to out run your past and make it back in time for the big show!

All cheesiness aside, Birdman's break-in is a point and click adventure based off of the famous lockout scene. This project was made by myself and 2 other team mates over the span of 4 weeks.

Birdman's break in features;

- Time trial puzzles
- Data driven encounters
- Item combination and trading And much more!

This project was coded in c++. The source code for this project can be found [Here (github)](https://github.com/JohnnersUK/birdmans-break-in) and can be compiled in visual studio 2017 with the Windows SDK 10.0.16299.0.

So far, this game is a 30 second set piece showcasing the scene management and data driven systems behind the scenes, expansion into a full game is unlikely.

This game has no affiliation with birdman or Alejandro González Iñárritu, it's just a silly uni project
